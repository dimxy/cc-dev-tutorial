When I joined Komodo team as a cryptocondition (now rebranded as custom consensus) contract developer I was assigned my first task: to develop a 'Heir' cryptocondition contract. 
My acquaintance with crypto conditions began with reading James Lee's book "Mastering Cryptoconditions". I spent a weekend on reading it and got the common idea what cc contracts are. 
But the whole scale of cc contract features and opportunities were uncovered to me later when I implemented the validation code for my 'Heir' cc contract.

Now I'd like to share my experience with developers who want to create very efficient and powerful custom consensus contracts to help them get the matter of what custom consensus contracts are, what they can do and how to develop them.

I will also try to explain some internal properties of cryptoconditons because I believe most developers like me want to know how everything is organized internally :-)

It is supposed you are a c++ developer.
For reading this article it is recommended that you have basic knowledge about bitcoin or Komodo blockchain, transaction structure and UXTO principle.  It is also good to know about script concept and especially OP_RETURN opcode as it plays important role in adding business logic to custom consensus contracts.

It might be not very simple for newbie developer to understand what cryptoconditions are and what they allow. 
I think this very simple 'Heir' cc contract which has commonly understandable purpose of inheritance will be a good demonstation of power and features of cryptoconditions.

Let's learn a bit about what I needed to develop.
The idea of the 'Heir' cc contract was inheritance of crypto funds: if funds owner was inactive for some specified time the fund's heir might use those funds.
Okay, let's move on.

### CC contract concepts

To understand cc contract idea and structure I studied well-known simple Faucet cc contract which actually allows to lock some amount of funds on a crypto condition address and draw funds by small portions. The Faucet cc does not allow to do this fast as it requires to do some PoW for successful funds drawing.

What did I know from the first experience with a cc contract?

First, I'd say it implements some business logic: in faucet cc contract this logic is about storing funds on some address and set a 'faucet' to take them back (maybe like in some advanced moneybox which would not allow spend all the funds at once). For 'Heir' cc contract the business logic is inheritance of the blockchain funds.

The next, contract's business logic is bound to transactions. In some sense transactions are a data source for cc contract application. As a usual blockchain transaction simply moves coin value from one address to another we need some place for application data to put into it. This place is so-called opreturn and it is a transaction output which is never spendable and where contract's data is stored. Usually opreturn is the last output in a transaction.
When a cc contract instance begins its lifecycle an initial transaction is created and later additional transactions are added and attached to the initial transaction by spending its outputs. Later more transactions might be added which spend outputs of newly added transactions.

The next important thing in a cc contract is cryptoconditions.
What is a cryptocondition and why it is important?

### Cryptoconditions in simple terms

A cryptocondition in Komodo is basically a logical expression executed on electronic signatures and hashes of spending transactions and stored in transactions' scripts, plus a supporting c-library which allows to evaluate and check such expressions. 
In wider sense, cryptoconditions is a technology which allows to build and evaluate complex logical expression based on results of cryptographic functions.

A cryptocondition consists of two parts: a condition stored in the transaction (which to be spent) output's scriptPubKey and cryptocondition fulfillment which is in the spending transaction input's scriptSig. 
The condition contains instructions and data to check cryptocondition (like pubkey).
The fulfillment has instructions and data how to evaluate cryptocondition (for example, an instruction to check spending transaction signature, signature value to be checked and the pubkey to verify the signature). 
When a tx which spends some tx cc output is validated its input's cc fulfillment is evaluated and the result is checked with the condition in the output of the tx which is to be spent.

The simplest cryptocondition is evaluating a electronic signature of spending transaction scriptsig and by that allowing to spend funds from some other transaction cc output. 
You might ask why we need this because this is already a function of any blockchain. Yes, but there is the difference: when a transaction cryptocondition output is spent the cc contract code might enforce additional logic to validate this spending.

Anyway, such a simple cryptocondition is only a basic feature.

Cryptoconditions allows to do more. For example, another often used cryptocondition is a threshold of N which evaluates to true if a spending tx is signed with one of N possible keys. Also, application validation is possible for this too. In 'Heir' cc contract description further in this doc we will see what validation would allow.

Cryptocondition might be a tree of subconditions which allows to build complex cryptoconditions.
I might say that cryptoconditions technology is very advanced development of basic bitcoin script security features like pubkey or pubkey hash scripts.

We now know that in Komodo there might be advanced transactions having cryptocondition inputs and outputs. Later we will know that such transactions are attached to some cc contract by a eval code stored in tx cryptocondition inputs and outputs.

### CC contract features

We might call a cc contract as a data and business logic layer of an application. Where data layer is transactions related to a cc contract and business logic is the cc contract's code.
A presentation layer could be a web or any other GUI application which connects to a cc contract.
Or, it might be a server application that interacts to cc contract (that is, an oracle). For interaction cc contract has a set of rpc functions.

When a transaction is created in the framework of a cc contract it sends some value from a cc address to another cc address (pubkey) on cc outputs plus some data in opreturn output. An initial cc contract transaction usually sends value from normal inputs to cc outputs.

Yet another often used cc contract property is cc global address. Each cc contract is assigned its own global publicly known address for which its private key is also available to all. This address might be used for sharing funds between cc contract users. Anyone might try to spend funds from such global cc contract address (it is also called 'unspendable' address in cc codebase which probably means 'unspendable without validation'). 
A spending tx must pass through the cc contract validation code which enforces various rules for spending from this address. For instance, if a tx sent some amount to the global address to use it as a marker for future finding this transaction with a special API function, the cc validation code might capture and prohibit spending from such cc output.
(Note that validation code might validate spending from any cc contract address, not only from the global cc address).

So a cc contract code has two parts: a set of rpc functions for creation of cc contract transactions and validation code which is triggered when a cc transaction is added to the chain.
Note that cc contract validation code is activated only for the transactions which have at least one cc input with the contract's eval code cryptocondition inside the scriptSig.
It is also important to understand that as cc contract's initial transaction might not have cc input at all, it never gets into the validation code. So it would be mined in the blockchain. If you still need to validate it you have to step back when validating the spending tx and also validate the initial tx. Plus, you cannot remove the initial tx from the chain if it turned out to be incorrect, so you just need to ignore it.
The main purpose of validation code is to prevent inappropriate structure and spending of cc contract transaction,  especially if someone tries to create a tx bypassing the contract's rpc functions.

That being said, for a cc contract development you would need:
* allocate a new eval code for your contract
* assign global cc and normal addresses for the new contract
* define the contract's transactions, their structure (inputs and outputs) and opreturn format
* implement the contract's rpc functions for creation of these transactions and to return contract's data and/or state
* implement standard rpc functions for getting list of all the contract's initial transactions and getting user's and global cc addresses
* implement the contract's validation code

### CC contract architecture

A cc contract is actually a c/c++ source file. The one part of is an rpc (remote procedure call) implementation code that either creates the contract's transactions or gets info about contract state (from existing transactions). So when you deploy your contract (actually adding its code to the Komodo source code) your rpc calls are added to komodo-cli client command line.

Basically all contracts have two methods xxxlist and xxxinfo \<initialtxid\>.
xxxlist rpc lists all initial transactions providing a key (inital txid) to an instance of cc contract data and xxxinfo outputs some info about a contract instance.

The other essential part of a cc contract is validation code. It will be uncovered later.

A unique 8-bit eval code is attached to each cc contract. It is used by komodo core transaction validation code to route transactions to a cc contract validation code, if a currently validated transaction is relevant to this contract.
This eval code is actually a simple cryptocondition which is a byte value and is present in any transaction relevant to a cc contract.

### CC contract transaction structure
Here on the diagram is a cc contract transaction structure sample.

![cc tx structure](https://github.com/dimxy/images/blob/master/cc-tx-structure-for-guide-v7.png)

We can see on the diagram that cc transaction has one or more cryptocondition inputs (or vins) and one or more cryptocondition outputs (or vouts). 
A cc input with cryptocondition contain the txid of a previous transaction which cc output is spent and a cryptocondition fulfillment which is evaluated when this tx is added to the blockchain. The previous tx cc output has the corresponding cryptocondition which value should match to the evaluated input cryptocondition fulfillment while validation occurs.
The tx has also opreturn output with some contract data.

### CC contract SDK

Although officially not called yet as SDK there is a set of functions for cc contract development. Most of it is in CCtx.cpp, CCutils.cc, cc.cpp, eval.cpp source files.
I will describe most used functions in the following section where I decompose 'Heir' cc contract development process.

## 'Heir' cc contract development
In this section I describe development of a simplified version of my 'Heir' cc contract.
As I stated above we need to add new contract's eval code and global addresses, define 'Heir' cc contract transactions, implement the rpc interface and validation code.
Adding new eval code and addresses is the same for all cc contracts and you might find hoe to do this in JL's 'Mastering Cryptocondions' book.
Let's continue with defining 'Heir' cc contract transactions. 

### 'Heir' cc contract transactions

Actually we need three transactions: an initial tx with which a user would create fund for inheritance, a tx for additional funding and a tx for spending funds by the owner or heir.
I'll try to describe these tx structure with the semi-formal notation used in James Lee 'Mastering cryptocondition' book which allows to specify vins or vouts position in a tx and their description.

#### fund coins transaction (initial):

* vins.*: normal inputs
* vout.0: funding CC 1of2 addr for the owner and heir
* vout.1: txfee for CC addr used as a marker
* vout.2: normal change
* vout.n-1: opreturn 'F' ownerpk heirpk inactivitytime heirname

Here is some explanation of the used notation:
* 'vins.*' means any number of inputs
* 'normal' means usual and not cc inputs or outputs
* 'vout.0' means an output with order number 0
* 'vout.n-1' means the last vout in list (usually it is opreturn vout with contract data)

So by a funding transaction an owner creates a contract instance (a funding plan) and deposits some fund for future spending. The funding is added from normal coin inputs. 

The main funding goes to vout.0. As we suppose that either the funds owner or heir might be able to spend the funds we use an advanced cryptocondition feature threshold of 2 (marked here as '1of2') which means that cryptocondition is fulfilled if a spending tx is signed by one of the two specified keys.

Some fee is sent to vout.1 for use of it as a marker. Marker will be used to list all created contract initial transactions by a special sdk function. 
There is a normal change to return back to the owner's pubkey the extra value.
Note that we would need to provide inputs not only for the funding but for the marker value and some fee for miners. Usually we use a constant value of 10000 satoshis (0.0001 coin) for such fees.

Note 'F' letter (from 'fund') in the opreturn structure. By convention the first byte of any opreturn is eval code (omitted in the description above) and the second byte is transaction functional id.
In the opreturn also stored owner and heir pubkeys, inactivity time (in secinds) and the descriptive name of this funding plan (contract instance). Inactivity time means that if no new funding was added or spent by the owner during this time then the heir is able to spend the funds.

Specification of the rest two transactions':

#### add coins transaction:

* vins.*: normal inputs
* vout.0: funding CC 1of2 addr for the owner and heir
* vout.1: normal change
* vout.n-1: opreturn 'A' fundingtxid HasHeirSpendingBegun

This transaction add more funds on the vout with 1of2 cryptocondition from normal coin inputs.
In the opreturn the txid of the initial transaction is added to bind this tx to this contract instance (funding plan).
There is an additional flag HasHeirSpendingBegun, which is turned to true when the Heir first time spends the inherited funding and therefore no need to wait ever again for the owner inactivity time. If this flag is still `false` the contract validation would not allow the heir to spend funds unless the inactivity time has passed. The cryptocondition features  does not allow to check timing so it is going to be the job for the 'Heir' cc contract validation code to check this. 

Note also the functional id 'A' which marks this tx as 'add' funding transaction.

#### claim coins transaction:

* vin.0: normal input txfee
* vin.1+: input from CC 1of2 addr
* vout.0: normal output to owner or heir address
* vout.1: change to CC 1of2 addr
* vout.2: change to user's addr from txfee input if any
* vout.n-1: opreturn 'C' fundingtx HasHeirSpendingBegun

This tx allows to spend funds by either the funds owner or heir. It has a normal input to add value for txfee for miners, a cc input foor spending the claimed value from 1of2 fund address.
As to outputs, the claimed value is sent to claimer's normal address, unspent change is returned to 1of2 address.
There is also the normal change.
Note the functional id 'C' in the opreturn. The other opreturn data are the same as in the 'add' ('A') transaction.

### 'Heir' cc contract rpc implementation
Now let's develop rpc functions  to create the transactions describe in the previous section.

#### heirfund rpc implementation
To make a rpc call we would need its name and parameters. For rpc creating an initial tx I chose the name of 'heirfund' and its parameters are derived from the defined tx structure. The syntax is:
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=YOURCHAIN heirfund amount name heirpubkey inactivitytime
```
where 'amount' is coins going to the initial tx vout.1, 'name' is some description, 'heirpubkey' is heir pubkey and 'inactivitytime' is in seconds.

Now let's write some code for this rpc.

To add a new command to komodo-cli we need to change source file src/server.cpp: add a new element to vRPCCommands array:
```
    { "heir",       "heirfund",   &heirfund,      true },
```

where "heir" is a common name for all heir contract rpc calls
"heirfund" is the name of the new command and '&heirfund' is the address of rpc interface function,
true means that the command description will be shown in the help command output ('false' is to hide it)

It is also necessary to add `heirfund` rpc function definition into the rpc/server.h source file. All rpc functions have pretty much the same declaration `UniValue heirfund(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp)`.

An rpc command implementation is actually two-level.
The first level is short rpc function which name matches to the rpc command name itself like `heirfund`. Its body is created in rpc source file in rpc/ subdirectory. It is short and just checks rpc parameters and needed environment and forward the call to the transaction creation code what is the second level.

I created rpc-level code in the wallet/rpcwallet.cpp file although it is much better to create a new rpc source file for each new cc contract's rpc functions.

heirfund first rpc level implementation:
```
// heirfund command rpc-level implementation, src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
UniValue heirfund(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp)
{
    CCerror.clear(); // clear global error object
```
Check that the wallet and 'Heir' cc contract features are available in the chain
and check the rpc params' required number:
```
    if (!EnsureWalletIsAvailable(fHelp))
        return NullUniValue;
    if (ensure_CCrequirements(EVAL_HEIR) < 0)
        throw runtime_error("to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet\n");
    // output help message if asked or params count is incorrect:
    if (fHelp || params.size() != 4 )
        throw runtime_error("heirfund funds heirname heirpubkey inactivitytime\n");
```	
Lock the user's wallet:
```
    LOCK2(cs_main, pwalletMain->cs_wallet);	
```
The UniValue object is a special type for passing data in rpc calls. Univalue params is actually an array of Univalue objects. We still need to convert them into usual c/c++ language types and pass to the contract implementation.
Next convert the params from UniValue type to the basic c++ types. 
```
    CAmount amount = atof(params[0].get_str().c_str()) * COIN;  // Note conversion from satoshis to coins by multiplication by 10E8
    std::string name = params[1].get_str();
    std::vector<uint8_t> vheirpubkey = ParseHex(params[2].get_str().c_str());
    CPubKey heirpk = pubkey2pk(vheirpubkey);
    int64_t inactivitytime = atoll(params[3].get_str().c_str());
```
We also need to add checks that the converted param values are correct (what I ommitted in this sample), for example not negative or not exceeding some limit.
Note how to parse hex representation of the pubkey param and convert it to CPubKey object.

And now time to call the 'Heir' cc contract code and pass the returned created tx in hexademical representation to the caller, ready to be sent to the chain:
```
    UniValue result = HeirFund(amount, name, heirpk, inactivitytime);
    RETURN_IF_ERROR(CCerror);  // use a macro to throw runtime_error if CCerror is set in HeirFund()
    return result;
}
```

The second implementation level is located in the 'Heir' cc contract source file src/heir.cpp.
Here is the skeleton of the heirfund rpc implementation.
```
// heirfund transaction creation code, src/cc/heir.cpp
std::string HeirFund(int64_t amount, std::string heirName, CPubKey heirPubkey, int64_t inactivityTimeSec)
{
```
First, we need to create a mutable version of a transaction object.
```
    CMutableTransaction mtx = CreateNewContextualCMutableTransaction(Params().GetConsensus(), komodo_nextheight());
```
Declare and initialize an CCcontract_info object with 'Heir' cc contract variables like cc global address, global private key etc.
```
    struct CCcontract_info *cp, C;
    cp = CCinit(&C, EVAL_HEIR);
```
Next we need to add some inputs to transaction that are enough to make deposit of the requested amount to the heir fund, some fee for the marker and for miners.
Let's use a constant fee = 10000 sat.
We need the pubkey from the komodod -pubkey param.
For adding normal inputs to the mutable transaction there is a corresponding function in the cc SDK. 
```
    const int64_t txfee = 10000;
    CPubKey myPubkey = pubkey2pk(Mypubkey());   
    if (AddNormalinputs(mtx, myPubkey, amount+2*txfee , 60) > 0) { 
```
The parameters passed to the AddNormalinputs() are the tx itself, my pubkey, total value for the funding amount, marker and miners fees, for which the function will add the necessary quantity of uxto for the private key in the user's wallet. The last parameter is the limit of uxto to add. 

Now let's add outputs to the transaction. Accordingly to our specification we need two outputs: for the funding deposit and marker
```
        mtx.vout.push_back( MakeCC1of2vout(EVAL_HEIR, amount, myPubkey, heirPubkey) );
        mtx.vout.push_back( MakeCC1vout(EVAL_HEIR, txfee, GetUnspendable(cp, NULL)) );
```
In this example we used two cc sdk functions for creating cryptocondition vouts. 

MakeCC1of2vout creates a vout with a threshold=2 cryptocondition allowing to spend funds from this vout with either myPubkey (which would be the pubkey of the funds owner) or heir pubkey

MakeCC1vout creates a vout with a simple cryptocondition which sends a txfee to 'Heir' cc contract global address (returned by GetUnspendable() function call). We need this output to mark the transaction and be able to find all cc heir funding plans. 
You will always need some kind of marker for any cc contract at least for contract's initial transaction, otherwise you might lose contract's data in blockchain.
We may call this as **marker pattern** in cc development. See more about the marker pattern later in the CC contract patterns section.

Finishing the creation of the transaction by calling FinalizeCCTx with params of the cp object, mtx object itself, the owner pubkey, txfee amount. 
Note the cast to uint8_t for the constants EVAL_HEIR and 'F' funcid, this is important as it is supposed one-byte size for serialization of these values (otherwise they would be 'int'). 
Also an opreturn object with the contract data is passed which is created by serializing the needed ids and variables to a CScript object.
```
        std::string rawhextx = FinalizeCCTx(0, cp, mtx, myPubkey, txfee,
            CScript() << OP_RETURN << (uint8_t)EVAL_HEIR << (uint8_t)'F' << myPubkey << heirPubkey << inactivityTimeSec << heirName));
        return rawhextx;
    }
```
Also, if AddNormalinputs could not find sufficient owner coins for the requested fund amount plus txfee, set error object.
```
    CCerror = "not enough coins for requested amount and txfee";
    return std::string("");
}
```
Note that we do not need to add the normal change output here because this job is done by FinalizeCCTx.
FinalizeCCTx also builds the transaction input scriptSigs (both normal and cryptocondition), adds signatures and returns signed transaction in hex.
Also note E_MARSHAL function which serializes variables of various types to a byte array which in turn is serialized to CScript object which is stored in scriptPubKey transaction field. There is also the mirror E_UNMARSHAL function.

The returned transaction is ready to be sent to the blockchain with sendrawtransaction rpc.

Now let's develop an rpc for claiming the funds.

#### heirclaim implementation

Again, this implementation will be two-level, with the first level to check the required environment and converting the parameters and the second level to create claiming transaction.
the heirclaim rpc call syntax is very simple:
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=YOURCHAIN heirclaim fundingtxid amount
```

Add a new command to komodo-cli by adding a new element in to vRPCCommands array in the source file src/server.cpp::
```
    { "heir",       "heirclaim",   &heirclaim,      true },
```

Add a heirclaim rpc call implementation (in rpc/wallet.cpp)
Add the heirclaim declaration in rpc/server.h header file.

```
// heirclaim command rpc-level implementation, src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp 
UniValue heirclaim(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp)
{
    CCerror.clear(); // clear global error object
```
check that the wallet is available. 
if asked for help or the param size is incorrect, return help message.
Also check that cc contract requirements are satisfied:
```
    if (!EnsureWalletIsAvailable(fHelp))
        return NullUniValue;
    if (fHelp || params.size() != 2)
	throw runtime_error("heirclaim txfee funds fundingtxid\n");
    if (ensure_CCrequirements(EVAL_HEIR) < 0)
	throw runtime_error("to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet\n");
```
Lock the wallet:
```
    LOCK2(cs_main, pwalletMain->cs_wallet);
```
Convert the parameters from UniValue to c++ types: 
```
    uint256 fundingtxid = Parseuint256((char*)params[0].get_str().c_str());
    CAmount amount = atof(params[1].get_str().c_str()) * COIN;  // Note conversion from satoshis to coins by multiplication by 10E8
```
Call the claim tx creation function and return the created tx in hexademical
```
    UniValue result = HeirClaim(fundingtxid, amount);
    RETURN_IF_ERROR(CCerror);  // use a macro to throw runtime_error if CCerror is set in HeirFund()
    return result;
}
```

Now implement the claim tx creation code.
```
// heirclaim transaction creation function, src/cc/heir.cpp
std::string HeirClaim(uint256 fundingtxid, int64_t amount)
{
```
Start with creating a mutable transaction object:
```
    CMutableTransaction mtx = CreateNewContextualCMutableTransaction(Params().GetConsensus(), komodo_nextheight());
```
Next, init the cc contract object:
```
    struct CCcontract_info *cp, C;
    cp = CCinit(&C, EVAL_HEIR);
```
Now we need to find the latest owner transaction to calculate the owner's inactivity time:
Use a developed helper FindLatestOwnerTx function which returns the lastest txid, the owner and heir public keys, inactivity time setting value and the hasHeirSpendingBegun flag value:
```
    const int64_t txfee = 10000;
    CPubKey ownerPubkey, heirPubkey;
    int64_t inactivityTimeSec;
    uint8_t hasHeirSpendingBegun;    
    uint256 latesttxid = FindLatestOwnerTx(fundingtxid, ownerPubkey, heirPubkey, inactivityTimeSec, hasHeirSpendingBegun);
    if( latesttxid.IsNull() )   {
        CCerror = "no funding tx found";
        return "";
    }
```
Now check if the inactivity time has passed from the last owner transaction. Use cc sdk function which returns time in seconds from the block with the txid in the params to the chain tip block.
If hasHeirSpendingBegun is set then no need to check again the owner inactivity time:
```
    int32_t numBlocks; // not used
    bool isAllowedToHeir = (hasHeirSpendingBegun || CCduration(numBlocks, latesttxid) > inactivityTimeSec) ? true : false;
    CPubKey myPubkey = pubkey2pk(Mypubkey());  // pubkey2pk sdk function converts pubkey from a byte array to CPubKey object
    if( myPubkey == heirPubkey && !isAllowedToHeir )    {
        CCerror = "spending funds is not allowed for heir yet";
        return "";
    }
```
Let's create the claim transaction inputs and outputs.
add normal inputs for txfee:
```
    if (AddNormalinputs(mtx, myPubkey, txfee, 3) <= txfee)    {
        CCerror = "not enough normal inputs for txfee";
        return "";
    }

```
Add cc inputs for the requested amount.
first get the address of the 1 of 2 threshold cryptocondition output where the funds were deposited:
```
    char coinaddr[65];
    GetCCaddress1of2(cp, coinaddr, ownerPubkey, heirPubkey);
```
Add cc inputs for this address with use of a custom function:
```
    int64_t inputs;
    if( (inputs = Add1of2AddressInputs(mtx, fundingtxid, coinaddr, amount, 64)) < amount )   {
        CCerror = "not enough funds claimed";
        return "";
    }
```
Now add an normal output to send claimed funds to and cc change output for the fund remainder:
```
    mtx.vout.push_back(CTxOut(amount, CScript() << ParseHex(HexStr(myPubkey)) << OP_CHECKSIG));  
    if (inputs > amount)
        mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1of2vout(EVAL_HEIR, inputs - amount, ownerPubkey, heirPubkey));  
```
Add normal change if any, add opreturn data and sign the transaction:
```
     return FinalizeCCTx(0, cp, mtx, myPubkey, txfee, CScript() << OP_RETURN << E_MARSHAL(ss << (uint8_t)EVAL_HEIR << (uint8_t)'C' << fundingtxid << (myPubkey == heirPubkey ? (uint8_t)1 : hasHeirSpendingBegun)));
}
```
In the opreturn we just added a pair of standard ids: cc eval code and functional id plus the fundingtxid as the funding plan identifier
We use a special flag hasHeirSpendingBegun that is turned to 1 when the heir first time spends funds. 
That means that it is no need further in checking the owner's inactivity time
Once set to 'true' this flag should be set to true in the following transaction opreturns

#### heiradd, heirlist and heirinfo implementation

The command `heiradd` allows to add more funding to the contract plan. The rpc command `heirlist` is a standard rpc method for all cc contracts and output a list of all initial txids (funding plans). The command `heirinfo` provides some data about a funding plan. 
The implementation for these rpcs can be found in the github repository with the source code of this contract. 

#### Simplified Add1of2AddressInputs function implementation

```
// add inputs from cc threshold=2 cryptocondition address to transaction object, src/cc/heir.cpp
int64_t Add1of2AddressInputs(CMutableTransaction &mtx, uint256 fundingtxid, char *coinaddr, int64_t amount, int32_t maxinputs)
{
    int64_t totalinputs = 0L;
    int32_t count = 0;
```
Call the cc sdk function SetCCunspents that fills the provider vector with a list of unspent outputs for the provider bitcoin address coinaddr (actually we passed here the 1of2 address where fund is stored)
```
    std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue>> unspentOutputs;
    SetCCunspents(unspentOutputs, coinaddr, true);  // get a vector of uxtos for the address in coinaddr[]
```
Go through the returned uxtos and add appropriate ones to the transaction's vin array:
```
    for (std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue>>::const_iterator it = unspentOutputs.begin(); it != unspentOutputs.end(); it++) {
         CTransaction tx;
         uint256 hashBlock;
         std::vector<uint8_t> vopret;
```
Load current uxto's transaction and check if it has an opreturn in the back of array of outputs: 
```
         if (GetTransaction(it->first.txhash, tx, hashBlock, false) && tx.vout.size() > 0 && GetOpReturnData(tx.vout.back().scriptPubKey, vopret) && vopret.size() > 2)
         {
              uint8_t evalCode, funcId, hasHeirSpendingBegun;
              uint256 txid;
```
Check if the uxto is from this funding plan: 
```
              if( it->first.txhash == fundingtxid ||   // if this is our contract instance coins 
                  E_UNMARSHAL(vopret, { ss >> evalCode; ss >> funcId; ss >> txid >> hasHeirSpendingBegun; }) && // unserialize opreturn
                  fundingtxid == txid  ) // it is a tx from this funding plan
              {
```
Add the uxto to the transaction's vins, that is, set the txid of the transaction and vout number providing the uxto. Pass empty CScript() to scriptSig param because it will be filled by FinalizeCCtx:
```
                  mtx.vin.push_back(CTxIn(it->first.txhash, it->first.index, CScript()));
                  totalinputs += it->second.satoshis;   
```
Stop if sufficient cc inputs have been found.
If amount parameter is 0 that would mean to add all available inputs to calculate all available fund amount
```
                  if( amount > 0 && totalinputs >= amount || ++count > maxinputs )
                      break;
              }
         } 
    }
```
Return the total inputs amount which has been added to the transaction vin array:
```
    return totalinputs;
}
```
#### Simplified FindLatestOwnerTx implementation

To calculate the owner inactivity time and to enable the heir to send the funds we need a function which enumerates transactions from the contract funding plan and finds the latest owner transaction.
This is this function implementation. The input parameter passed into it is initial funding txid. The function returns the owner and heir pubkeys, the owner inactivity time and a flag if the heir has already spent the funds. 

All the function returned values are retrieved from the transactions' opreturns. 

```
// find the latest owner transaction id
// this function also returns some values from the initial and latest transaction opreturns
// Note: this function is also called from validation code (use non-locking calls)
uint256 FindLatestOwnerTx(uint256 fundingtxid, CPubKey& ownerPubkey, CPubKey& heirPubkey, int64_t& inactivityTime, uint8_t &hasHeirSpendingBegun)
{
    uint8_t eval, funcId;
```
Initialize the flag as if the heir has not begun to spend the funds yet:
```
    hasHeirSpendingBegun = 0; 
```
Init some variables:
```
    CTransaction fundingtx;
    uint256 hashBlock;
    std::vector<uint8_t> vopret;
    std::string name;
```
Load the initial funding tx, check if it has a correct opreturn and deserialize it. 
Check tx rules and return empty id if the funding tx could not be loaded or is incorrect:
```
    if (!myGetTransaction(fundingtxid, fundingtx, hashBlock) ||  // NOTE: use non-locking version of GetTransaction as we may be called from validation code
        fundingtx.vout.size() == 0 ||    // no vouts, even opreturn
        !GetOpReturnData(fundingtx.vout.back().scriptPubKey, vopret) ||   // could not get opreturn from the last vout
        !E_UNMARSHAL(vopret, ss >> eval; ss >> funcId; ss >> ownerPubkey; ss >> heirPubkey; ss >> inactivityTime; ss >> name;) ||  // could not unmarshal opreturn
        eval != EVAL_HEIR ||   // incorrect eval code in 1st byte 
        funcId != 'F')    // incorrect funcid in the 2nd byte
        return zeroid;
```   
Init cc contract object for heir contract eval code:
```
    struct CCcontract_info *cp, C;
    cp = CCinit(&C, EVAL_HEIR);
```
Get the address of cryptocondition '1 of 2 pubkeys' into coinaddr array (where the fund is stored):
```       
    char coinaddr[64];
    GetCCaddress1of2(cp, coinaddr, ownerPubkey, heirPubkey); 
```
Get the vector with uxtos for the `1 of 2 address`:
```
    std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue>> unspentOutputs;    
    SetCCunspents(unspentOutputs, coinaddr, true);				 
```
Go through uxto's to find the last funding or spending owner tx:
```
    int32_t maxBlockHeight = 0; 
    uint256 latesttxid = fundingtxid;   // set to initial txid
    for (std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue>>::const_iterator it = unspentOutputs.begin(); it != unspentOutputs.end(); it++)
    {
        CTransaction vintx;
        uint256 blockHash;
        std::vector<uint8_t> vopret;
        uint8_t eval, funcId, flagopret;
        uint256 txidopret;

        int32_t blockHeight = (int32_t)it->second.blockHeight;
```
Get a transaction from the returned array,
check and unmarshal its opret and check if the current tx is from this funding plan:
```
        if (myGetTransaction(it->first.txhash, vintx, blockHash) &&     // NOTE: use non-locking version of GetTransaction as we may be called from validation code
            vintx.vout.size() > 0 &&
            GetOpReturnData(vintx.vout.back().scriptPubKey, vopret) &&
            E_UNMARSHAL(vopret, ss >> eval; ss >> funcId; ss >> txidopret; ss >> flagopret) &&
            eval == EVAL_HEIR &&
            (funcId == 'C' || funcId == 'A') &&
            fundingtxid == txidopret )   {
```
As SetCCunspents function returns uxtos not in the chronological order we need to order them by the block height as we need the latest one:
```
            if (blockHeight > maxBlockHeight) {

```
Now check if this tx was the owner's activity:
use pair of cc sdk functions that walk through vin array and find if the tx was signed with the owner's pubkey:
```
                if (TotalPubkeyNormalInputs(vintx, ownerPubkey) > 0 || TotalPubkeyCCInputs(vintx, ownerPubkey) > 0) {
```
Reset the lastest txid to this current txid if this tx is owner's activity,
set the flag from the tx opretun:
```
                    latesttxid = it->first.txhash;
		    hasHeirSpendingBegun = flagopret;
                    maxBlockHeight = blockHeight;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
Return found the latest owner transaction id:
```
    return latesttxid;
}
```

#### Simplified validation function implementation

Validation is the second important part of cc contract source code (the first is rpc functions for cc contract transaction creation) as it provides the logic control of cc contract value being spent and the data being added to the block chain. 

Remember that validation code is invoked for a transaction when the cc contract value is being spent and not when it just being added. In other words, the cc contract validation function invokation is triggered if at least one of a transaction inputs is a cc input with this contract eval code in it.
So for the first cc contract initial transaction the validation code usually is not called. To provide the validation of the initial tx you need to step back when validating the successive tx which spends the initial tx. In this step back you could load the initial tx and validate it too. If it turned out to be invalid it would remain in the chain and should be skipped and not taken into account. (If cc marker is used it might be cleared and such tx is removed from the contract instances list output.)

Not let's decide what validation we need for our simplified 'Heir' cc contract.

Actually we have just tree transaction in this contract: initial funding, adding more value and claiming tx. As initian or adding tx do not have cc vins they are validated together with claming transaction.

What needs to be validated? 

Here is some common rules relevant to most contracts:

* Obviously the first is the basic transaction structure and especially basic data structure in opreturn to ensure data integrity in the chain.
All opreturns should contain the eval code and functional id in the first two bytes. 
* When validating a tx, please remember about possible attacks and do not allow DOS attacks if a tx is incorrectly formed, check array size before use of it.
* Load and check the initial tx for this tx by retrieving the txid from the opreturn and load the initial tx.

The specific rules for 'Heir' cc contract transactions:

* For the funding tx it is good to validate that 1 of 2 address really matches pubkeys in the opreturn.
* For the tx which spend the funds it is important to validate the txid in the opreturns and opreturn of the tx being spent ('vintx') which binds the tx to the contract instance data, so the txids should be equal to the initial txid.   
* Obviously we should validate if the heir is allowed to spend the funds, that is either enough time has passed from the last owner activity or the heir has already begun spending (the flag is on).
* Although 'Heir' cc contract is for the inheritance of the owner's funds, nothing prevents from adding more coins to the fund's address by anyone else. So we need to select only the owner transactions while checking the owner's inactivity (that is, the transactions with the owner pubkey in its vins).
* Actually while checking these specific transaction rules we also would check opreturn format more fully.

To get the HeirValidate() validation function activated for the 'Heir cc contract eval code we followed JL's 'Mastering Cryptocondition' book instructions while we added a new cc contract to the system's code.

This is HeirValidate implementation:
```
// Tx validation entry function, it is a callback actually
// params: 
// cpHeir pointer to contract variable structure
// eval pointer to cc dispatching object, used to return invalid state
// tx is the tx itself
// nIn not used in validation code
bool HeirValidate(struct CCcontract_info* cpHeir, Eval* eval, const CTransaction& tx, uint32_t nIn)
{
```
Common validation rules for all funcid.
First let's check basic tx structure, that is, has opreturn with correct basic evalcode and funcid
Note: we do not check for 'F' or 'A' funcids because we never get into validation code for the initial tx or for an add tx as they have no heir cc vins ever:
```
    std::vector <uint8_t> vopret;
    if( tx.vout.size() < 1 || !GetOpReturnData(tx.vout.back().scriptPubKey, vopret) || vopret.size() < 2 || vopret.begin()[0] != EVAL_HEIR || 
        vopret.begin()[1] != 'C')
        // interrupt the validation and return invalid state:
        return eval->Invalid("incorrect or no opreturn data");  // note that you should not return simply 'false'
```
Let's try to decode tx opreturn, fundingtxid is this contract instance id (the initial tx id):
```
    uint8_t evalcode, funcId;
    uint256 fundingtxid; //initialized to null
    uint8_t hasHeirSpendingBegun;
    if (!E_UNMARSHAL(vopret, ss >> evalcode; ss >> funcId; ss >> fundingtxid; ss >> hasHeirSpendingBegun;))
        // return invalid state if unserializing function returned false:
        return eval->Invalid("incorrect opreturn data");
```
Important to check if fundingtxid parsed is okay:
```
    if( fundingtxid.IsNull() )
        return eval->Invalid("incorrect funding plan id in tx opret");
```
It is good place to load the initial tx and check if it exist and has correct opretun
We are callinng FindLatestOwnerTx function to obtain opreturn parameters and hasHeirSpendingBegun flag,
and this function also checks the initial tx:
```
    CPubKey ownerPubkey, heirPubkey;
    int64_t inactivityTimeSec;
    uint8_t lastHeirSpendingBegun;
    uint256 latesttxid = FindLatestOwnerTx(fundingtxid, ownerPubkey, heirPubkey, inactivityTimeSec, lastHeirSpendingBegun);
    if (latesttxid.IsNull()) {
        return eval->Invalid("no or incorrect funding tx found");
    }
```
Just log we are in the validation code:
```
    std::cerr << "HeirValidate funcid=" << (char)funcId << " evalcode=" << (int)cpHeir->evalcode << std::endl;
```
Validation rules specific for each funcid:
```
    switch (funcId) {
```
For F and A return invalid as we never could get here for the initial or add funding tx:
```    
    case 'F':
    case 'A':
        return eval->Invalid("unexpected HeirValidate for heirfund");
```
Validation for claiming transaction:
```
    case 'C':
	// Check if the correct funding txns are being spent, like this txns are from this contract instance identified by fundingtxid
        if (!CheckSpentTxns(cpHeir, eval, tx, fundingtxid))
            return false;
	// If the heir claiming the funds check whether he is allowed to do this 
	// (inactivity time passed or he has already begun spending)
        // Also check if the new flag hasHeirSpendingBegun is set correctly:
        if (!CheckInactivityTime(cpHeir, eval, tx, latesttxid, inactivityTimeSec, heirPubkey, lastHeirSpendingBegun, hasHeirSpendingBegun) )
            return false;
        break;
```
For unsupported funcids return invalid state:
```
    default:
        std::cerr << "HeirValidate() illegal heir funcid=" << (char)funcId << std::endl;
        return eval->Invalid("unexpected HeirValidate funcid");
    }
```
All rules are passed return okay:
```
    return eval->Valid();   
}
```

Supporting functions CheckSpentTxns and CheckInactivityTime both are in heir.cpp source


### Validation code errors 

During the validation code development you will probably receive validation errors when cc contract validate function returns invalid state. Here how those errors looks like:

when sending raw transaction the tx is checked while added to mempool, if cc validation returns invalid state ou would see error: 
```
error code: -26
error message:
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)
```

In this case it is good to see the server output for more extended error:
```
CC Eval EVAL_HEIR Invalid: incorrect opreturn data spending tx 4b6e1ed868cf941dabf9edc7f675321bdb4258692ba02f56dc21100f88981ac4
ERROR: CScriptCheck(): 7961fe4f9f3bdabef154404ea8ec7a11be1546febc34efe67faede8d930c0749:1 VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element
ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: BUG! PLEASE REPORT THIS! ConnectInputs failed against MANDATORY but not STANDARD flags 7961fe4f9f3bdabef154404ea8ec7a11be1546febc34efe67faede8d930c0749
```
The first line actually contains your validation code eval->invalid() message.

## Some used terminology

Here is some terms and keywords which are used in the cc documentation, developers chats and cc contracts code 
* cryptocondition - in simple terms an encoded expression and supporting c-library which allows to check several types of logical conditions based on electronic signatures and hashes. Frequently used cryptocondition is checking that some transaction is signed by one of several possible keys.
* cc contract - custom consensus contract (rebranded cryptocondition contract)
* cc input - tx cryptocondition input spending value from cc output
* cc output - tx output with cryptocondition encoded
* normal inputs - inputs spending value from normal tx outputs (not cryptocondition outputs)
* normal outputs - not cryptocondition outputs but usual tx outputs like pubkey or pubkeyhash
* opreturn, opret - a special output item in transaction, usually the last one, which is prepended by OP_RETURN script opcode and therefore is never able to spend. We put user and contract data into it.
* plan - an instance of cc contract data, that is, a set of all the relevant transactions, usually beginning from an initial tx whose txid serves a whole plan's id. Any cc contract has a list function to return a list of all the created plans.
* tx, txn - short of `transaction`
* txid - transaction id, a hash of a transaction
* 'unspendable' address - the global cc contract address, for which its public and private key are commonly known. It is used for conditionally sharing funds between contract users. As its private key is not a secret theoretically, anyone can request spending value from this address, but cc contract validation code might and usually does apply various business logic conditions and checks about who can spend the funds from the and what he or she should provide to be able to do this (usually the spending transaction and/or its previous transactions are checked)
* vin - input or array of inputs in transaction structure (tx.vin)
* vout - output or array of outputs in transaction structure (tx.vout)

## CC contract patterns

Earlier I wrote about the marker pattern. Here I'd like collect other useful patterns (including the marker pattern too) which are useful in the development of custom consensus contracts.

### Baton pattern
Baton pattern allows to organize a single-linked list in a blockchain. Starting from the first tx in a list we may iterate the other transactions in the list and retrieve the values stored in their opreturns.

### Marker pattern
Marker pattern is used to mark all similar transactions by sending some small value to a common fixed address (most commonly it is a cc contract global address).
Actually you can create either normal marker or cc marker for future finding the transactions.
If you create a normal marker you cannot control that someone can spend the value from it (as cc global address private key is not a secret). As such marker could be spent you should use cc sdk function Settxids() function to retrieve all transaction with markers in the cc contract list function.

We may use another tecnique for marker and use an unspendable cc marker by using some value to a cc output into some known address. In this case for retrieving transaction list you may use another cc sdk function SetCCunspents which returns a list of transactions with unspent outputs for the appointed address.
If you decide to use an unspendable cc marker you should disable its spending in the validation code otherwise as in some predefined way. If, for example, you allow spending from it by a burning tx you would have such burned markers hidden from the list of initial transactions.
The cc contract validation code should disable unauthorised tries to spend such markers.
An issue with the cc marker case which needs to be considered is if the cc global address is used for storing not only the marker value but other funds you would need to provide that the marker value . 

Code example for finding the transactions marked with normal marker:
```
    std::vector<std::pair<CAddressIndexKey, CAmount> > addressIndex;
    struct CCcontract_info *cp, C;
    cp = CCinit(&C, <some eval code>);
    SetCCtxids(addressIndex, cp->normaladdr, false);                      
    for (std::vector<std::pair<CAddressIndexKey, CAmount> >::const_iterator it = addressIndex.begin(); it != addressIndex.end(); it++) 	{
        CTransaction vintx;
        uint256 blockHash;
        if( GetTransaction(it->first.txhash, vintx, blockHash, false) ) {
            // check tx and add its txid to a list
        }
    }
```
You may find more examples how to find marked transactions in any cc contract standard list function.
Note for SetCCtxids() function to work, the komodod `txindex` init parameter should be set to 1 (which is by default).

Code example for finding transactions marked with an unspendable cc marker:
```
    std::vector<std::pair<CAddressIndexKey, CAmount> > addressIndex;
    struct CCcontract_info *cp, C;
    cp = CCinit(&C, <some eval code>);
    SetCCunspents(addressIndexCCMarker, cp->unspendableCCaddr, true);    
    for (std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue> >::const_iterator it = addressIndexCCMarker.begin(); it != addressIndexCCMarker.end(); it++) {
        CTransaction vintx;
        uint256 blockHash;
        if( GetTransaction(it->first.txhash, vintx, hashBlock, false) ) {
            // check tx and add its txid to a list
        }
    }
```
For CCunspents function to work komodod init parameters `addressindex` and `spentindex` should be both set to '1'

### Txidaddress pattern
Txidaddress pattern might be used when you need to send some value to an address which never could be spent. For this there is a function to get an address for which no private key ever exists
In payments CC we use this for a spendable address, by using:
CTxOut MakeCC1of2vout(uint8_t evalcode,CAmount nValue,CPubKey pk1,CPubKey pk2, std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char>>* vData)

For the merge RPC we use the vData optional parameter to append the op_return directly to the ccvout itself, rather than an actual op_return as the last vout in a transaction. Like so: 
```
opret = EncodePaymentsMergeOpRet(createtxid);
std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char>> vData = std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char>>();
if ( makeCCopret(opret, vData) )
    mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1of2vout(EVAL_PAYMENTS,inputsum-PAYMENTS_TXFEE,Paymentspk,txidpk,&vData));
GetCCaddress1of2(cp,destaddr,Paymentspk,txidpk);
CCaddr1of2set(cp,Paymentspk,txidpk,cp->CCpriv,destaddr);
rawtx = FinalizeCCTx(0,cp,mtx,mypk,PAYMENTS_TXFEE,CScript());
```
This allows a payments ccvout to be spent back to its own address, without needing a markervout or an OP_RETURN by using a modification made to IsPaymentsvout:
```
int64_t IsPaymentsvout(struct CCcontract_info *cp,const CTransaction& tx,int32_t v,char *cmpaddr, CScript &ccopret)
{
    char destaddr[64];
    if ( getCCopret(tx.vout[v].scriptPubKey, ccopret) )
    {
        if ( Getscriptaddress(destaddr,tx.vout[v].scriptPubKey) > 0 && (cmpaddr[0] == 0 || strcmp(destaddr,cmpaddr) == 0) )
            return(tx.vout[v].nValue);
    }
    return(0);
}
```
 
In place of IsPayToCryptoCondition we can use getCCopret function which is a lower level of the former call, that will return us any vData appended to the ccvout along with true/false for IsPayToCryptoCondition. 
In validation we now have a totally diffrent transaction type than exists allowing to have diffrent validation paths for diffrent ccvouts. And also allowing multiple ccvouts of diffrent types per transaction.
``` 
if ( tx.vout.size() == 1 )
{
    if ( IsPaymentsvout(cp,tx,0,coinaddr,ccopret) != 0 && ccopret.size() > 2 && DecodePaymentsMergeOpRet(ccopret,createtxid) )
    {
        fIsMerge = true;
    } else return(eval->Invalid("not enough vouts"));
}
```

## Various tips and tricks in cc contract development
### Test chain mining issue
On a test chain consisting of two nodes do not mine on both nodes - the chain might get out of sync. It is recommended to have only one miner node for two-node test chains.

### Try not to do more than one AddNormalInputs call in one tx creation code
FillSell function calls AddNormalInputs two times at once: at the first time it adds txfee, at the second time it adds some coins to pay for tokens. 
I had only 2 uxtos in my wallet: for 10,000 and 9 ,0000,000 sat. Seems my large uxto has been added during the first call and I receive 'filltx not enough utxos' message after the second call. I think it is always better to combine these calls into a single call.

### Nodes in your test chain are not syncing
You deployed a new or updated developed cc contract in Komodo daemon and see a node could not sync with other nodes in your network (`komodo-cli ac_name=YOURCHAIN getpeerinfo` shows synced blocks less than synced heaeds). It might be seen errors in console log.
Most commonly it is the cc contract validation code problem. Your might have changed the validation rules and old transactions might become invalid. It is easy to get into this if you try to resync a node from scratch. In this case old transactions should undergo the validation.
Use validation code logging and gdb debug to investigate which is the failing rule.
If you really do not want to validate old transactions you might set up the chain height at which a rule begin to action with the code like this:
if (strcmp(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL, "YOURCHAIN") == 0 && chainActive.Height() <= 501)
    return true;
Use hidden `reconsiderblock` komodo-cli command to restart syncing from the block with the transaction which failed validation.

### Deadlocks in validation code
If komodod hangs in cc contract validation code you should know that some blockchain functions use locks and might cause deadlocks. You should check with this functions and use non-locking versions.
An example of such function is GetTransaction(). Instead you should use myGetTransaction() or eval->GetConfirmed()

## What next? Contract architecture extending for token support
My contract should work both with coins and tokens. The program logic for inheritance coins and tokens was very the same, so I used templates for contract functions which were extended in specific points to deal either with coins or tokens (like to make opreturn and cc vouts). In the next part of this tutorial I will show ho to deal with tokens.

This is a second part of the tutorial how to write a cc contract.
Now I would like to show how to add token support into Custom Consensus (cc) contract in Komodo asset chain.

What is actually a token?

Tokens's another name is also 'colored coin' what I would explain as 'coins with some additional info'. Buth there is another difference: 
token is not mined but issued by an individual who just has public and private key and some coins in a blockchain which supports tokens.
Usually the purpose of a token is to represent in a blockchain some real-world asset which usually is owned by the token issuer like shares, 
tickets, oil, or even fiat money pegged to a token.
In Komodo world blockchains where tokens live are called 'asset chains'.
